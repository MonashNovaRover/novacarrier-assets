# uPD720201 EEPROM Dump Notes:
/upd72020x/upd720201_eeprom_dump/upd72020x-load dump files directory contains the binary firmware for the uPD720201 USB 3.0 chipset extracted from a commercial off-the-shelf mini-PCIe card. The firmware has been extracted using the upd72020x-load repository by @markusj (https://github.com/markusj/upd72020x-load).

### To extract the firmware off of the COTS mini-PCIe card
```bash
git clone https://github.com/markusj/upd72020x-load
cd upd72020x-load
make
sudo ./upd72020x-load -r -b bus -d dev -f func -s size -o dump_file.bin
```
where bus, dev and func can be determined by using lspci (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lspci.8.html)

```bash
lspci
```
size is the size of the output file dump_file.bin to read into (in hexadecimal - 0x80000 for 512KB/4Mbit).

The COTS mini-PCIe card uses a 4Mbit Bright Moon Semiconductor T25S40 EEPROM. The extracted file is named dump_4Mbit.bin. Most of the dump_4Mbit.bin file is empty and a truncated 128KB/1Mbit firmware file (dump.bin) has been included for convience of smaller 1Mbit EEPROMs (untested).  

You may encounter issues opening the PCIe device file if the PCIe domain is not 0000, if this is the case edit line 625 in upd72020x-load.c to the domain location specificed by lspci.

```
sprintf(pcicfgfile, "/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:%02x:%02x.%01x/config",
            bus, dev, fct);
```
